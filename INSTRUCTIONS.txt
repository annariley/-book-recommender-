Running the Web App

To run the web app first make sure you are in the: webapp/book-recommender directory.

Here run: npm install
to install the required modules for the front-end. 


For the backend you will need to install the the following python modules (listed below as the pip command to run):
pip install flask
pip install flask-restful
pip install flask-pymongo
pip install torch
pip install pandas
pip install dnspython
pip install pymongo
pip install numpy

Now you can start the backend by calling: python api.py
and start the front end by calling: npm start

If you run into any issues running these you may be missing a package, check the error you received, and if you are missing a package install it using similar commands as above.
Some possible examples would be:
npm install react-tinder-card
npm install react-scripts
npm install react-scripts start
npm install @ui-materials/core
npm install @ui-materials/icons

To restart the runtime for the Frontend you only need to refresh the page. For the backend you need to stop the script, and run python api.py again

Understanding the file structure of this repo:
webapp/book-recommender: This folder contains all the files needed for the webapps operation
cleanup_dataset.py: This is a separate script that was used to upload the books to MongoDB - do not run it

Also note development was done in a different github repository - so commits on this repo do not reflect who developed what.
