Re RL model integration: For now, I would not worry about efficiency or performance, and focus solely on getting it to work. As you pointed out, the programming paradigm for the backend (especially for REST apis where things are stateless) is slightly different from how you would normally do so in a Jupyter notebook so make sure you design that in a high level before trying to dive right into the implementation. For example, you may have to consider querying the database to construct the dataset used for online training, as opposed to keeping a Dataset class.
